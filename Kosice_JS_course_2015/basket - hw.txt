You're task is implementing some web shop basket functionality.

You have an array of products each product has name price and inventory.

What you need to do is implement "addProduct", "removeProduct", "updateProductQuantity" and "getTotalPrice" of basket object. 

"ProductsID" is just index of product in the array in our case it can be "0" or "1"
For that matter you also need to implement additional class "productLineItem" to store quantity and also we need to store some state of basket(probably an array of added products). 

"addProduct" adds product to basket (1 item), and subtracts 1 from inventory. It can be called more than one per each product. Throw an error if product gets out of stock or productID is not valid

"removeProduct" function removes all of items of defined products in case there's one and throws an error otherwise.

"updateProductQuantity" set defined quantity to item of defined product, throws an error if any input parameter is invalid

"getTotalPrice" return total cost of all products added to cart (productPrice[1] * quiantity[1] + productPrice[2] * quiantity[2] +... + productPrice[n] * quiantity[n])
